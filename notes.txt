Margin collapsing in LayoutNG, etc... - chat with ikilpatrick at TPAC 2018 - 25. Oct
====================================================================

 * Single pass.

You get your root BFC. All coordinates relative to it.

 * Block offset
 * Line offset (inline but w/o direction)

MarginStrut {
  biggest_positive_margin
  smallest_negative_margin
}

Always compute the pos a child relative to its parent block, you only reposition
the float...

When you reach a new BFC you need to do potentially 2 layouts to determine what
is positioned.

Layout in parallel?

 * You can lay out in parallel all direct children that stablish a BFC.
 * ng_exclusion_space.cc: Float positioning and co. Shelves algorithm exploiting
   floats' properties.
